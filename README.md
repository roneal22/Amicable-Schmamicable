# Amicable-Schmamicable
 Assignment 6: Amicable Numbers

Tasks
Your task is to use Javascript to determine if two numbers are amicable. 
A pair of numbers are amicable if their factors (excluding themselves) add up to each other.  (A factor is a number that divides evenly into another number.)
For example, the numbers 220 and 284 are amicable, because the factors of 220 are [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110] and sum to 284,  and the factors of 284 are [1, 2, 4, 71, 142] and sum to 220.

The following is required for this assignment:

Get two values from the user to check if they are amicable.  To get the numbers, use a form with two input boxes and a button.
 Display the result in a <div> below the button as “The numbers:  xxx and yyy are amicable”
     “The numbers:  xxx and yyy are not amicable”   where xxx and yyy are the numbers you read from the form.    
 Create a pop up to display the factors or each of the numbers for diagnostic purposes.
  You must use functions – you will be graded in part on how modular you can make your program.  Hint: a helpful function would be:  isAFactor(x,y)  that returns true if x is a factor of y.
 You must use arrays

Questions
Identify three differences and three similarities between C++ and Javascript
Differences: variable types, auto arraylists, don't need to declare return types
Similarities: comment format, Object-Oriented Programming languages, 


What is your opinion of Javascript as a programming language?
I first worked with js in high school in my first CS class, which meant that I had more nostalgia for it than memory of how to write it. It's a little difficult to get used to the small differences from C++ after COMP11, such as variable declaration
